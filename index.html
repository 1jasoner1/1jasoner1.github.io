              <article>
                <p>I found myself devoted to the whole concept of IT during my adolescent years although it all started when I first used a PC at the age of 9. At that age I was just playing games and my mind wandered around settings to help find out how everything ran,
                  and I was very intrigued by it at that age. During my junior year I picked up IST as my elective and continued to do that up until my senior year, which I then picked IPT. Throughout the experiences I had in those two subjects,
                  I was exploring on reddit for more Indepth information about security and ever since then I was more interested in how everything worked and have a deeper understanding of security and how it is so important to watch out for trivial things on the internet.
                  I picked up a couple of software skills for example; Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Time Management, use of Gantt Charts and Google Sketch up. After graduating, I enrolled in Network Security at TAFE, but I did not end up finishing it due to personal reasons,
                  but I did learn how to use Wireshark and Python, briefly. Although I did drop out, I did not keep out of touch with the subject, and it motivated me to go back into university and study it again.</p>
